# What2Do Android app for making social plans with groups
This was a project for CSCI 5115 User Interface Design, Implementation, and Evaluation at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities in spring 2021 (orignally hosted on github.umn.edu).

Took a project from the ground up with a team of 6 - from user research through multiple iterations of evaluations (cognitive walkthroughs, heuristic evaluations, and user testing) and prototyping - by developing an Android project in Java to facilitate groups making social plans. Implemented with RecyclerLayout, Dialogs, and [CardStackView](https://github.com/yuyakaido/CardStackView).

You can download the app and run it in an Android emulator using Android Studio or on an actual device. Note: this is a user tested prototype, the backend is not fully implemented.

Created with Lana Berge (berg2789), David Brunner (brunn214), Jimmy Nguyen (nguy3571), Nick Seel (seel0121), and Jacqueline Sorenson (sore0361), UMN CSCI students.
